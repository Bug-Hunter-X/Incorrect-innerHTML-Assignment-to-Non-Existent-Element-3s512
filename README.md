# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect innerHTML on Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates an uncommon yet significant bug in HTML and JavaScript interaction. The bug involves attempting to modify the `innerHTML` of a DOM element that does not yet exist. While the immediate consequence may appear minor in this isolated example, in larger applications, this pattern could lead to subtle errors, unexpected behavior, and difficulties in debugging.

The `bug.html` file shows the incorrect code.  The solution, in `bugSolution.html`, demonstrates a robust approach that avoids this issue by first checking for the existence of the element before attempting modification.
